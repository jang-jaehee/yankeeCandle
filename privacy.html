                        company, address, phone number, e-mail address and line of business. You may also be providing us with data regarding
                        your device, your client or supplier account, etc. These kinds of data will in many circumstances be considered as personal
                        data under applicable data protection legislation.</p>

                        any information (including such categories of personal data) provided to Newell Brands, in order to comply with such process
                        and to protect our rights and property. If warranted, we may also allow access to this information in special emergencies
                        where physical safety is at risk.</p>

                        to distinguish you from other users of our website and of websites of our network. This helps us provide you with a good experience when

                    <p>In many cases, these tags/files lead to the use of your device’s processing or storage capabilities. Some of these tags/files are set by
                        Newell Brands itself, others by third parties; some only last as long as your browser session, while others can stay active on your

                    <p>These tags/files can fall into several categories: (i) those that are necessary for functionality or services that you request or for the
                        transmission of communications (functionality tags/files); (ii) those that we use to carry out performance and audience metrics regarding
